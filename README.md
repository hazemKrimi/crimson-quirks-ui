# Crimson Quirks UI

A UI component library utilizing Vite and Storybook to be used in my personal projects.

## Requirements

You need to have `react` and `styled-components` already installed as they are peer dependencies.

## Installation

To install the package using `yarn` run the following command:

```
yarn add crimson-quirks-ui
```

You can use any other package manager you prefer like `npm`.

## Development

If you want to add more components for example and you want a development environment you can use `storybook`:

```
yarn storybook
```

## Reference

I used this [Starter Component Library Repo](https://github.com/dev-divein/react-storybook-tailwind) as a reference.
